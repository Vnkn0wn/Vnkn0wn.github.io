      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello everyone, my name is Álvaro. I am a former Electronic Engineer who decided to quit his job and start studying what I have always liked... Videogames!

        I am very passionate about the entire process, from empathizing and defining to ideating, prototyping, and testing cool interactive and immersive experiences.
        
        Although I am currently in a designer role, it doesn't mean that I only enjoy level design. Thanks to my engineering background, programming is not an issue for me!
